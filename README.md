# Icon To Cursor
Convert a .ico file to a .cur file with offsets.

### NOTE:
This is the first time I am writing something in Odin,\
I am new to this language and am still learning it.\
So expect issues!

Wrote this for fun, and because I needed it.\
I like the cursor in "Cult of the Lamb", \
and I wanted to use it for my desktop.

Initially I used a hexeditor and fixed the .ico file\
myself, but I figured this could be a neat little\
excercise in learning Odin, so I tried to write\
an application to do this for me.

## How to use:
1. Put the `IconToCursor.exe` in the same folder as your `.ico` file.
2. Run `IconToCursor.exe`.
3. Type in the icon file name (including the `.ico` part).
4. Type in the x coordinate (from left to right).
5. Type in the y coordinate (from top to bottom).
